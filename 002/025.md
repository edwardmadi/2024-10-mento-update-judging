# Admin cannot set ExchangeExpansionConfig.expansionRate to 1e18 as expected

### Summary

As mentioned in README, the expected ExchangeExpansionConfig.expansionRate values set by admin are between 1 and 1e8:

> gooddollar/GoodDollarExpansionController::setExpansionConfig(bytes32 _exchangeId, uint64 expansionRate, uint32 expansionFrequency)
**expansionRate = Between 1 and 1e8**
expansionFrequency > 0

However, [setExpansionConfig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L125) prevents admin setting expansionRate to 1e18:

```solidity
  function setExpansionConfig(bytes32 exchangeId, uint64 expansionRate, uint32 expansionFrequency) external onlyAvatar {
@>  require(expansionRate < MAX_WEIGHT, "Expansion rate must be less than 100%");
    require(expansionRate > 0, "Expansion rate must be greater than 0");
    require(expansionFrequency > 0, "Expansion frequency must be greater than 0");

    exchangeExpansionConfigs[exchangeId].expansionRate = expansionRate;
    exchangeExpansionConfigs[exchangeId].expansionFrequency = expansionFrequency;

    emit ExpansionConfigSet(exchangeId, expansionRate, expansionFrequency);
  }
```

### Root Cause

In [GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L126](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L126), there is check on `expansionRate` which prevents admin from setting the value to 1e18.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin calls to set ExchangeExpansionConfig.expansionRate.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Admin calls to set ExchangeExpansionConfig.expansionRate to 1e18 and the transaction will revert.

### Impact

Admin cannot set ExchangeExpansionConfig.expansionRate to 1e18 and this is a break of README.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
  function setExpansionConfig(bytes32 exchangeId, uint64 expansionRate, uint32 expansionFrequency) external onlyAvatar {
-    require(expansionRate < MAX_WEIGHT, "Expansion rate must be less than 100%");
+    require(expansionRate <= MAX_WEIGHT, "Expansion rate must no larger than 100%");
    require(expansionRate > 0, "Expansion rate must be greater than 0");
    require(expansionFrequency > 0, "Expansion frequency must be greater than 0");

    exchangeExpansionConfigs[exchangeId].expansionRate = expansionRate;
    exchangeExpansionConfigs[exchangeId].expansionFrequency = expansionFrequency;

    emit ExpansionConfigSet(exchangeId, expansionRate, expansionFrequency);
  }
```

# Admin cannot set exchange reserveRatio to 1 as expected

### Summary

As mentioned in README, the expected `_exchange.reserveRatio` values set by admin are between 1 and 1e8:

>gooddollar/GoodDollarExchangeProvider::createExchange(PoolExchange _exchange):
_exchange.reserveRatio = Between 1 and 1e8
 _exchange.exitContribution = Between 1 and 1e8

However, [validateExchange()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L354) prevents admin from setting `_exchange.reserveRatio` to 1:

[BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L354-L365](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L354-L365):
```solidity
  function validateExchange(PoolExchange memory exchange) internal view {
    require(exchange.reserveAsset != address(0), "Invalid reserve asset");
    require(
      reserve.isCollateralAsset(exchange.reserveAsset),
      "Reserve asset must be a collateral registered with the reserve"
    );
    require(exchange.tokenAddress != address(0), "Invalid token address");
    require(reserve.isStableAsset(exchange.tokenAddress), "Token must be a stable registered with the reserve");
@>  require(exchange.reserveRatio > 1, "Reserve ratio is too low");
    require(exchange.reserveRatio <= MAX_WEIGHT, "Reserve ratio is too high");
    require(exchange.exitContribution <= MAX_WEIGHT, "Exit contribution is too high");
  }
```

### Root Cause

In `BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L362`, there is check on `exchange.reserveRatio` which prevents admin from setting the value to 1.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin calls to set `exchange.reserveRatio`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Admin calls to set `exchange.reserveRatio` to 1 and the transaction will revert.

### Impact

Admin cannot set exchange reserveRatio to 1 and this is a break of README.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow admin to set exchange reserveRatio to 1 as mentioned in README:

```diff
  function validateExchange(PoolExchange memory exchange) internal view {
    require(exchange.reserveAsset != address(0), "Invalid reserve asset");
    require(
      reserve.isCollateralAsset(exchange.reserveAsset),
      "Reserve asset must be a collateral registered with the reserve"
    );
    require(exchange.tokenAddress != address(0), "Invalid token address");
    require(reserve.isStableAsset(exchange.tokenAddress), "Token must be a stable registered with the reserve");
-   require(exchange.reserveRatio > 1, "Reserve ratio is too low");
+   require(exchange.reserveRatio >= 1, "Reserve ratio is too low");
    require(exchange.reserveRatio <= MAX_WEIGHT, "Reserve ratio is too high");
    require(exchange.exitContribution <= MAX_WEIGHT, "Exit contribution is too high");
```

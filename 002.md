### Attack Path

AMMs provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see [[Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L229)]) and [[Uniswap V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L119)]. If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades:

1. Alice wants to swap 100 `tokens` for 1 `ETH` and later sell the 1 `ETH` for 1000 `DAI`.
2. The transaction is submitted to the mempool, however, Alice chose a transaction fee that is too low for miners to be interested in including her transaction in a block. The transaction stays pending in the mempool for extended periods, which could be hours, days, weeks, or even longer.
3. When the average gas fee dropped far enough for Alice's transaction to become interesting again for miners to include it, her swap will be executed. In the meantime, the price of `ETH` could have drastically changed. She will still get 1 `ETH` but the `DAI` value of that output might be significantly lower. She has unknowingly performed a bad trade due to the pending transaction she forgot about.

An even worse way this issue can be maliciously exploited is through MEV:

1. The swap transaction is still pending in the mempool. Average fees are still too high for miners to be interested in it. The price of `tokens` has gone up significantly since the transaction was signed, meaning Alice would receive a lot more `ETH` when the swap is executed. 
2. A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated maximum slippage value now allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches Alice, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for Alice

### Impact
Due to the absence of the check user's exact amount might not be swapped due to increase/decrease in the price of the asset or more simply user's will have to resubmit their transaction

### Mitigation

Introduce a `deadline` parameter to all functions which potentially perform a swap .

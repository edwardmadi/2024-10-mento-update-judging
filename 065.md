# `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromReserveBalance()` will always revert or misbehave for `reserveAsset`s with less than 18 decimals.

### Summary

`GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromReserveBalance()` does **not** normalise the `contractReserveBalance` to 18 decimals making the function unusable for `reserveAsset`s with less than 18 decimals since it will always revert or misbehave.

### Root Cause

In `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromReserveBalance()`, there is no normalisation to 18 decimals for the `contractReserveBalance` which will be in the native decimals of the ERC20. However, the `reserveBalance` of the `PoolExchange` **is** normalised to 18 decimals. The subtraction of them will, most likely, result to the transaction to be reverted since it will try to do `e6 - e18`. As we can see in the implementation:
```solidity
  function mintUBIFromReserveBalance(bytes32 exchangeId) external returns (uint256 amountMinted) {
    IBancorExchangeProvider.PoolExchange memory exchange = IBancorExchangeProvider(address(goodDollarExchangeProvider))
      .getPoolExchange(exchangeId);

// @>    uint256 contractReserveBalance = IERC20(exchange.reserveAsset).balanceOf(reserve);
// @>    uint256 additionalReserveBalance = contractReserveBalance - exchange.reserveBalance;
    if (additionalReserveBalance > 0) {
      amountMinted = goodDollarExchangeProvider.mintFromInterest(exchangeId, additionalReserveBalance);
      IGoodDollar(exchange.tokenAddress).mint(address(distributionHelper), amountMinted);

      // Ignored, because contracts only interacts with trusted contracts and tokens
      // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
      emit InterestUBIMinted(exchangeId, amountMinted);
    }
  }
```

As we can see the subtraction tries to subtract a normalised amount(`exchange.reserveBalance`) from a non normalised amount in native decimals (` contractReserveBalance`). It is, almost, sure that it will revert or misbehave.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `reserveAsset` of the `PoolExchange` to have less than 18 decimals, which is very likely and that's way `Mento` has introduced the `tokenPrecisionMultipliers` mapping on `BancorExchangeProvider`.

### External pre-conditions

1. Someone to call `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromReserveBalance()`, in order to mint UBI (`G$` tokens) from the `additionalReserveBalance` of `reserve` contract.

### Attack Path

1.`PoolExchange` with a `reserveAsset` with less than 18 decimals is created (6 decimals for example). This is expected from `Mento` and that's why the `tokenPrecisionMultipliers` have been introduced in `GoodDollarExchangeProvider`.
2. `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromReserveBalance()` function get called so to mint some `G$` from the reserve balance.
3. The transaction will revert and the functionality is unusable for ever.

### Impact

The impact of this bug is that `mintUBIFromReserveBalance()` functionality will be broken for `exchanges` with `reserveAsset` with less than 18 decimals, and there will be absolutely no way to mint UBI from the excess balance of `Reserve` contract. This is one of the main functionalities of the `GoodDollarExpansionController` and it will be broken for **all** assets which don't have 18 decimals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate successfully this vulnerability, normalise the `contractReserveBalance` to 18 decimals before the subtraction with `exchange.reserveBalance` .

# Issue with minting of G$ tokens in some scenarios

## Summary
Issue with minting of G$ tokens in some scenarios  because of decimal calculation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol allows for permissionless minting of good dollar(G$) tokens when there is a difference between the contract reserve balance and the virtual balance through [this function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L152-L161).
According to the [contest READMe](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update-Pascal4me#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate) it says tokens are whitelisted and standard ERC20 is 'implied' also accross the codebase ERC20 tokens were scaled a lot of times so its safe to assume that the protcol will work with tokens with < 18 decimals. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the reserve contract actual  balance is not scaled to 18 decimals against `exchange.reservebalance` the variable it's being subtracted with which is always scaled before operating on and stored. So when the token is < 18 decimals, this will bring up many issues including 

1. Contract reverting  due to under flow which can DOS minting for a very long time especially if the decimal is low
2.  Lower amount  of tokens being minted etc.

## Impact
DOS of crucial function for an unpredictable time, wrong amount of tokens being minted 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Scale the reserve balance before calculation

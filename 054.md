# Exchange ID Collision Can Occur

### Summary

When creating an exchange on BancorExchangeProvider, exchangeID is determined only based on symbols of the tokens being used. Since only the symbols are being used rather than unique identifiers, collision of IDs can occur when a token shares a symbol (such as Compound USD and Celo USD do with cUSD) or if the symbols packing together form the same string (since abi.encodePacked is used, USD/CUSD will have the same ID as USDC/USD). This can lead to assets being permanently blocked from having pools created.

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin adds a pool that has possible collisions. With tokens coming out every day, it's impossible to know what might collide.
2. If a token pair in the future with the same packed string wants to be added, it will not be allowed on the protocol.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Can cause the contract to be incompatible with certain assets. While it isn't very likely to occur, it completely blocks the contract's ability to function with some tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use token address rather than token symbol to determine exchange ID.

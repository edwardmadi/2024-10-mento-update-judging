Passive Aquamarine Beetle

# The broker's swapIn or swapOut functions cannot be used.

### Summary

An attacker can make it impossible to pass the Limits by continuously swapping a small number of tokens, thus making the swapIn or swapOut functions unusable.

### Root Cause

When tradingLimitState is updated, if _deltaFlow is very small, the calculation of _deltaFlowUnits will be 0 due to the trade-off problem. At this time, deltaFlowUnits will be counted as 1 (tokenIn), so an attacker can use 1 tokenIn to increase netflow.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Gas price is very low

### Attack Path

Continuously call the swapIn function with amountIn = 1 to make netflow0, netflow1, or netflowGlobal reach the limit

### Impact

The netflow increases due to low-quality swapIn transactions (amountIn == 1), which will cause swapIn transactions to be unable to proceed due to restrictions for a certain period of time, or swapIn transactions to be affected. Even if swapOut transactions reduce netflow, attackers can still increase netflow again through low-quality swapIn transactions (amountIn == 1).

### PoC

### Mitigation

Set the AMOUNT_MIN variable
```solidity
+ uint256 public AMOUNT_MIN;

  /// @inheritdoc IBroker
  function swapIn(
    address exchangeProvider,
    bytes32 exchangeId,
    address tokenIn,
    address tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 amountOutMin
  ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 amountOut) {
+ require(AMOUNT_MIN < amountIn);
    require(isExchangeProvider[exchangeProvider], "ExchangeProvider does not exist");
    // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-benign
    amountOut = IExchangeProvider(exchangeProvider).swapIn(exchangeId, tokenIn, tokenOut, amountIn);
    require(amountOut >= amountOutMin, "amountOutMin not met");
    guardTradingLimits(exchangeId, tokenIn, amountIn, tokenOut, amountOut);

    address reserve = exchangeReserve[exchangeProvider];
    transferIn(payable(msg.sender), tokenIn, amountIn, reserve);
    transferOut(payable(msg.sender), tokenOut, amountOut, reserve);
    emit Swap(exchangeProvider, exchangeId, msg.sender, tokenIn, tokenOut, amountIn, amountOut);
  }

  /// @inheritdoc IBroker
  function swapOut(
    address exchangeProvider,
    bytes32 exchangeId,
    address tokenIn,
    address tokenOut,
    uint256 amountOut,
    uint256 amountInMax
  ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 amountIn) {
+ require(AMOUNT_MIN < amountOut);
    require(isExchangeProvider[exchangeProvider], "ExchangeProvider does not exist");
    // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-benign
    amountIn = IExchangeProvider(exchangeProvider).swapOut(exchangeId, tokenIn, tokenOut, amountOut);
    require(amountIn <= amountInMax, "amountInMax exceeded");
    guardTradingLimits(exchangeId, tokenIn, amountIn, tokenOut, amountOut);

    address reserve = exchangeReserve[exchangeProvider];
    transferIn(payable(msg.sender), tokenIn, amountIn, reserve);
    transferOut(payable(msg.sender), tokenOut, amountOut, reserve);
    emit Swap(exchangeProvider, exchangeId, msg.sender, tokenIn, tokenOut, amountIn, amountOut);
  }

# `TradingLimits::update()` does not check if `_deltaFlowUnits` is smaller than `MIN_INT48` allowing anyone to bypass the limits

### Summary

[TradingLimits::update()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/libraries/TradingLimits.sol#L124) only checks that the tokens traded are smaller than the max, `require(_deltaFlowUnits <= MAX_INT48, "dFlow too large");`, but if the direction of the tokens is out of the exchange, `_deltaFlowUnits` will be negative and may be smaller than the minimum `int48` number, but this is not checked.

As it is downcasted to `int48` below, `int48 deltaFlowUnits = int48(_deltaFlowUnits);`, whenever `_deltaFlowUnits` is smaller than `type(uint48).min`, it will wrap around and become the maximum `int48` number minus the amount that `_deltaFlowUnits` is smaller than `type(uint48).min`.

As such, even if the current netflow limit is reached in the negative direction, it is still possible to swap further in this direction by swapping more than `type(uint48).min` out of the exchange, bypassing the limits.

### Root Cause

In `TradingLimits:131`, it only checks that `_deltaFlowUnits` is smaller than `MAX_INT48`, but not `MIN_INT48`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `Broker::swapIn/Out()`, which triggers the trading limits update and check, but does not revert if the user sends `type(int48).min` amount in as it will actually add this amount as positive to netflow and not revert.

### Impact

Trading limits may be bypassed.

### PoC
Run the following test confirming the behaviour:
```solidity
function test_POC_tradingLimits_unsafeDowncasting() public pure {
  int256 deltaFlowUnits = int256(type(int48).min) - 1;
  assertEq(int48(deltaFlowUnits), 1.40737488355327e14); //@audit becomes positive
}
```

`TradingLimits::update()` does not check `_deltaFlowUnits` for the minimum and then `int48(_deltaFlowUnits)` wraps around.
```solidity
function update(
  ITradingLimits.State memory self,
  ITradingLimits.Config memory config,
  int256 _deltaFlow,
  uint8 decimals
) internal view returns (ITradingLimits.State memory) {
  int256 _deltaFlowUnits = _deltaFlow / int256((10 ** uint256(decimals)));
  require(_deltaFlowUnits <= MAX_INT48, "dFlow too large"); //@audit does not check if _deltaFlowUnits is smaller than `MIN_INT48

  int48 deltaFlowUnits = int48(_deltaFlowUnits); //@audit unsafe downcasting will wrap around and become positive
  if (deltaFlowUnits == 0) {
    deltaFlowUnits = _deltaFlow > 0 ? int48(1) : int48(-1);
  }
  ...
```

### Mitigation

Add the minimum check:
`require(_deltaFlowUnits >= MIN_INT48 && _deltaFlowUnits <= MAX_INT48, "dFlow too large");`

# G$ expanded supply can be significantly less than expected

### Summary

Timing mechanism in function `GoodDollarExpansionController#mintUBIFromExpansion()` can cause the G$ total number of expansions significantly lower than expected when considering in time scale month or year

### Root Cause

- The function `GoodDollarExpansionController#mintUBIFromExpansion()` can mint G$ supply if it is called in the first time OR it is called after passed the expansion frequency. Since expansion is done daily, then expansion frequency should be 1 days (also from tests, its value is `86400`)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L175-L176

- The number of expansions since the previous expansion is calculated as:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L229-L233
Note that the number of expansions is rounded down

- The last expansion timestamp is updated to current block timestamp, which will be used for calculation at the next expansion
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L179

With the above points, the total number of expansions in a year could be significantly less than 365 expansions a year because of the cumulative rounding error. 
It is very likely because there is no bots to daily execute the function in time to mitigate the cumulative rounding error. 


### Internal pre-conditions

1. DAO creates a pool exchange
2. Someone daily calls `mintUBIFromExpansion()` at timestamp that `(block.timestamp - lastExpansion) % expansionFrequency > 0`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. DAO creates a pool exchange
2. Someone daily calls `mintUBIFromExpansion()` at timestamp that `(block.timestamp - lastExpansion) % expansionFrequency > 0`. Note that, the higher the remainder, the more difference it is between "total number of expansions per year" with the value 365

### Impact

- The total expansion token to be minted in a month/year could be significantly less than expected
- G$ supply expansion speed is lower, which affects tokenomics

### PoC

The PoC below shows how the cumulative rounding error affects the total number of expansions in a year
```solidity
    function test_expansion_cumulative_rounding_error(uint e) public {
        uint256 lastExpansion = 0; // init value
        uint256 blockTime = 1; // init an arbitrary value
        uint256 frequency = 1 days; // daily expansion
        uint256 totalExpansions = 0; // init value
        uint256 totalTime; // the total time passes onchain since the first expansion

        while (totalTime < 365 days) {
            if (lastExpansion == 0) {
                totalExpansions += 1;
            } else if (blockTime > lastExpansion) {
                totalExpansions += (blockTime - lastExpansion) / frequency;
            }

            totalTime += (blockTime - lastExpansion); // add total time

            lastExpansion = blockTime; // update value for last expansion timestamp

            // random block timestamp
            // will pass 1 day from lastExpansion
            // have random remainder
            uint randomRemainder = (uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(e, lastExpansion, lastExpansion))) % frequency);
            blockTime = lastExpansion + frequency + randomRemainder;
        }
        
        // totalExpansions approx eq 365 with delta = 10%
        assertApproxEqRel(totalExpansions, 365, 0.1 * 1e18);
    }

```
Run the test and console shows:
```bash
[FAIL. Reason: assertion failed: 253 !~= 365 (max delta: 10.0000000000000000%, real delta: 30.6849315068493150%); counterexample: calldata=0x4cd7a413000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000078a args=[1930]] test_expansion_precision(uint256) (runs: 0, Î¼: 0, ~: 0)
```
It shows how difference between the actual number of expansions compared to the expected amount 365 expansions a year

### Mitigation

Update expansion timing mechanism to day-based, example:
```diff
-bool shouldExpand = block.timestamp > config.lastExpansion + config.expansionFrequency;
+uint32 day = block.timestamp / 1 days * 1 days;
+bool shouldExpand = day >= config.lastExpansionAsDay + config.expansionFrequency;
```

# UBI Minting Failure Due to Unbounded Expansion Calculations

### Summary

Unbounded exponentiation in the reserve ratio scalar calculation will cause UBI minting failures for GoodDollar users as high expansion rates combined with delayed updates will trigger arithmetic overflow.


### Root Cause

At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L177 in  GoodDollarExpansionController.sol:_getReserveRatioScalar() the unbounded numberOfExpansions calculation combined with powu() operation on small stepReserveRatioScalar values can trigger arithmetic overflow when processing delayed UBI expansions.

This vulnerability is realistic as GoodDollar's core function requires frequent UBI distribution, which can face both technical delays and governance delays (emergency pauses, policy changes).

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Protocol sets high expansionRate close to MAX_WEIGHT through setExpansionConfig()
2. Time passes without UBI expansions being processed
3. When mintUBIFromExpansion() is called:
```solidity
numberOfExpansions = (block.timestamp - config.lastExpansion) / config.expansionFrequency;
stepReserveRatioScalar = MAX_WEIGHT - config.expansionRate; // Very small value
return unwrap(powu(wrap(stepReserveRatioScalar), numberOfExpansions)); // Overflows
```
4. The powu() operation fails due to overflow
5. UBI minting transaction reverts

### Impact

GoodDollar users cannot receive UBI distributions as the minting function fails. This creates a complete denial of service for the core UBI distribution functionality.

Detailed numerical example:
Given:
- expansionRate = 0.999e18
- MAX_WEIGHT = 1e18
- expansionFrequency = 86400 (1 day)
- Time delay = 60 days

Results in:
- stepReserveRatioScalar = 1e18 - 0.999e18 = 0.001e18
- numberOfExpansions = 60
- powu(0.001e18, 60) overflows uint256

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a maximum limit for numberOfExpansions that can be done at a time.

# Whenever the reserve asset of the exchange is also a stable asset of the reserve, the reserve will not increase in value

### Summary

[Broker::transferIn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/swap/Broker.sol#L238) and [Broker::transferOut()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/swap/Broker.sol#L218) mint and burn the token if it is a stable asset from the reserve, given by `Reserve.isStableAsset()`. Whenever the reserve asset of an exchange is both a stable asset and a collateral asset of the reserve, it will always be minted and burned, which is wrong, as the reserve assets from the exchange should be transferred in and out of the reserve.. This means that the protocol's reserve will not increase in value due to swapping as it will always be minted and burned.

### Root Cause

In `Broker:218` and `Broker:238` it should mint/burn or transfer if the token is a supply token or reserve token of the exchange, not if it is a stable or collateral asset. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Reserve token of the exchange is both a stable asset and a collateral asset of the reserve.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. `Broker::swapIn()` and `Broker::swapOut()` are called but the reserve assets are minted/burn instead of transferred in/out of the reserve.

### Impact

The reserve will not increase in value due to swapping.

### PoC

`Broker::transferIn()` and `Broker::transferOut()`:
```solidity
function transferOut(address payable to, address token, uint256 amount, address _reserve) internal {
  IReserve reserve = IReserve(_reserve);
  if (reserve.isStableAsset(token)) {
    IERC20(token).safeMint(to, amount);
  } else if (reserve.isCollateralAsset(token)) {
    require(reserve.transferExchangeCollateralAsset(token, to, amount), "Transfer of the collateral asset failed");
  } else {
    revert("Token must be stable or collateral assert");
  }
}

...

function transferIn(address payable from, address token, uint256 amount, address _reserve) internal {
  IReserve reserve = IReserve(_reserve);
  if (reserve.isStableAsset(token)) {
    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
    IERC20(token).safeBurn(amount);
  } else if (reserve.isCollateralAsset(token)) {
    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(from, address(reserve), amount);
  } else {
    revert("Token must be stable or collateral assert");
  }
}
```

### Mitigation

Minting/burning should be performed in the exchange's [tokenAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/interfaces/IBancorExchangeProvider.sol#L8) and transferring in the [reserveAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/interfaces/IBancorExchangeProvider.sol#L7).

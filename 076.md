# When _deltaFlow is zero, deltaFlowUnits is incorrectly set to -1

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/098b17fb32d294145a7f000d96917d13db8756cc/mento-core/contracts/libraries/TradingLimits.sol#L134
When _deltaFlow == 0:
	Calculate _deltaFlowUnits:
```solidity
_deltaFlowUnits = 0 / (10 ** uint256(decimals)) = 0
```

	Convert to int48:
```solidity
deltaFlowUnits = int48(0)
```

	Enter conditional check:
```solidity
if (deltaFlowUnits == 0) { ... }
```

	Since _deltaFlow == 0, _deltaFlow > 0 is false.
	Thus, deltaFlowUnits is set to -1:
```solidity
deltaFlowUnits = int48(-1)
```


	Problem:
When the net flow change _deltaFlow is zero, the system should not modify deltaFlowUnits.
Setting deltaFlowUnits to -1 causes the net flow to be erroneously reduced without an actual change.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect Net Flow Update: The net flow will decrease without any real transaction, which may trigger erroneous limits.
State Inconsistency: The net flow state does not match actual transaction activity, potentially causing logical errors in the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the conditional check to ensure deltaFlowUnits is only adjusted when _deltaFlow is non-zero.

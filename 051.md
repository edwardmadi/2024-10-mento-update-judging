# Incorrect modifier logic in BancorExchangeProvider.sol

### Summary

`swapIn()` and `swapOut()` in `BancorExchangeProvider.sol` both have the [modifier onlyBroker](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L70-L74), 
which checks if the caller is the `Broker.sol`.

This is problematic because `Broker.sol` is intended to call the `GoodDollarExchangeProvider::swapIn()/swapOut()`, and in it, it will call the `BancorExchangeProvider.sol::swapIn()/swapOut()`, thus reverting because the caller is not the address of broker, but the `GoodDollarExchangeProvider.sol`. 

### Root Cause

The issue is that the `Broker.sol` is going to call the `GoodDollarExchangeProvider::swapIn()` as it is the main contract with which we will initiate `swapIn()` and `swapOut()` and it will call `BancorExchangeProvider::swapIn()`.

This means that the caller of the `BancorExchangeProvider::swapIn()` is not going to be the `Broker.sol` contract, but the `GoodDollarExchangeProvider.sol`, thus reverting due to the [modifier onlyBroker](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L70-L74) checking if the caller is specifically the `Broker.sol` and not the `GoodDollarExchangeProvider.sol` as well.

### Attack Path

Alice calls the `Broker::swapIn()`, which will then call `GoodDollarExchangeProvider::swapIn()`, which will then invoke the `BancorExchangeProvider::swapIn()` and will **result in a revert** due to [the following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L70-L73) - the caller is going to be `GoodDollarExchangeProvider.sol` contract, not the `Broker.sol` contract.

### Impact

The `GoodDollarExchangeProvider::swapIn()` & `GoodDollarExchangeProvider::swapOut()` will be uncallable 
 due to the `modifier onlyBroker` in both swap functions in `BancorExchangeProvider.sol`.



### PoC

### Mitigation

Change the `modifier onlyBroker` in `BancorExchangeProvider.sol` to include the address of the `GoodDollarExchangeProvider.sol` as well

# `Broker`'s `limitId`s may clash and mix trading limits of different tokens

### Summary

The `Broker` [calculates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/swap/Broker.sol#L201) the trading limit ids as `exchangeId ^ token`, which is vulnerable to clashing. Two different `exchangeId` and `token` pairs can yield the same result. For example, suppose that a pair exchangeId1 and tokenId1 first bit is 1, the result is 0. If another pair exchangeId2 and tokenId first bit is 0, result is also 0. If we extrapolate for all bits, clashing is possible.

### Root Cause

In `Broker:201,271,272`, the trading limit id `exchangeId ^ tokenIn` is vulnerable to clashing.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

1. `ExchangeId` and `token` have `ids` and addresses, respectively, that clash.

### Attack Path

1. Different `exchangeId` and tokens are added whose trading limit id clashes.
2. Users swap in and out and the trading limits get mixed up.

### Impact

The trading limit from different exchanges and tokens is treated as being the same due to the clashing.

### PoC

Explained in the summary how clashing is possible.

### Mitigation

Use a trading limit id that is clashing proof, such as doing the hash of the exchange id and token address, which are both unique.

# Trading limits may be easily triggered by using a flashloan which will DoS users swapping in one direction

### Summary

[Broker::guardTradingLimit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/swap/Broker.sol#L282) updates the current netflow of trading, which is the previous amount traded in the exchange and if the new netflow exceeds the limits specified in `tradingLimitConfig`, it reverts. Malicious users may use flashloans to make the `tradingLimitState` netflows reach close to the limits to DoS users swapping.

### Root Cause

In `Broker:swapIn/Out()`, no per block trade limit is applied to protect the protocol from flashloans.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User picks a flashloan from another protocol at a 0% rate (some protocols offer this).
2. User calls `Broker::swapIn/Out()` to increase the stored `netflow` and not allow other users to swap due to reaching the limit.
3. User sells the results from the swap and repays the flashloan.

### Impact

The protocol instantly reaches the trading limit and gets DoSed.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Implement a per block trading limit so users can not abuse flash loans.

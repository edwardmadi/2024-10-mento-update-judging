# `GoodDollarExpansionController::setExpansionConfig()` will modify the `expansionFrequency` and trigger a significant `numberOfExpansions` at once

### Summary

[GoodDollarExpansionController::setExpansionConfig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L131) changes the `expansionFrequency`, which will make a jump in the number of expansions when the frequency is decreased. The number of expansions to trigger in `GoodDollarExpansionController::_getReserveRatioScalar()` is given by `(block.timestamp - config.lastExpansion) / config.expansionFrequency;`, thus if the `config.expansionFrequency` is suddently decreased, it will lead to a bigger number of expansions.

The percentage of the expansion to expand, `stepReserveRatioScalar`,  is given by `(MAX_WEIGHT - config.expansionRate) ^ numberOfExpansions`, which means it could change the expansion from, for example, 0.99 to 0.99^3.

### Root Cause

In `GoodDollarExpansionController:132`, the frequency is changed without compensating the effect on the `stepReserveRatioScalar` calculation in `GoodDollarExpansionController::_getReserveRatioScalar()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `GoodDollarExpansionController::setExpansionConfig()` with a smaller expansion frequency.
2. Anyone calls `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()` and the `GoodDollarExpansionController::_getReserveRatioScalar()` produces a sudden expansion increase.

### Impact

The protocol expands too much at once.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Change `config.lastExpansion` when setting the new frequency to some value that does not cause a sudden jump in the number of expansions.

# `BancorExchangeProvider::_createExchange()` `exchangeId` may clash which will make it impossible to use some tokens

### Summary

[BancorExchangeProvider::_createExchange()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L232-L234) calculates `exchangeId` as:
```solidity
exchangeId = keccak256(
  abi.encodePacked(IERC20(exchange.reserveAsset).symbol(), IERC20(exchange.tokenAddress).symbol())
);
```
Which is vulnerable to clashing as `abi.encodePacked` is used on 2 strings. For example, the token pairs `sUSD` and `DUSD` will clash with `sUSDD` and `USD`, making the second pair impossible to use. 

### Root Cause

In `BancorExchangeProvider:232`, `exchangeId` is vulnerable to clashing.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

1. Token pair clashing as explain in the summary section above.

### Attack Path

1. `BancorExchangeProvider::createExchange()` is called with a pair of tokens with symbols that clash with an already existing exchange.

### Impact

The protocol can not create exchanges for certain pairs.

### PoC

See explanation in the summary section.

### Mitigation

Use `abi.encode` instead.

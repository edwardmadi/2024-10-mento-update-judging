# `Celo` governance may change the protocol contracts which will lead to stuck funds in the exchange

### Summary

Celo provides a [checklist](https://docs.celo.org/integration/checklist#addresses) with guidelines on how to build on Celo. They specifically say that protocol contracts should never be hardcoded and should be fetched from the registry instead. This is the case for `cUSD` for example, as mention in the [docs](https://docs.celo.org/developer/contractkit/contracts-wrappers-registry#interacting-with-celo--cusd), which should be fetched from the registry.

However, `Mento` hardcodes the asset addresses in the protocol in several instances, such as in [BancorExchangeProvider::exchanges](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L31), the mapping that stores the pool's information in a `struct` `PoolExchange`, with fields `reserveAsset` and `tokenAddress`. `reserveAsset` is supposed to be one of the protocol's tokens, `cUSD` for example, which will lead to issues when the governance decides to change these addresses.

### Root Cause

In `BancorExchangeProvider:31`, the `struct` `PoolExchange` hardcodes the reserve asset address (`cUSD`, for example).

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

1. Governance changes the `cUSD` address, which is expected and warned in the documentation.

### Attack Path

1. Exchange is created with `cUSD` as reserve asset.
2. Celo changes the `cUSD` address.

### Impact

Stuck funds and exchange DoS.

### PoC

Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.celo.org/integration/checklist#addresses) for proof.

### Mitigation

Store a reference to fetch the address of the reserve asset from the registry instead of hardcoding it.

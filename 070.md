# Calling `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()` when the `tokenSupply` is low will mint little $G and still increase the reserve ratio

### Summary

[GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L170) is called every `config.expansionFrequency` seconds to mint $G. The amount to mint is based on the formula:
`amountToMint = (tokenSupply * reserveRatio - tokenSupply * newRatio) / newRatio`, which scales linearly to `totalSupply`.
As there is no constraint in the amount that is minted, it may be called when the `tokenSupply` is really low and yield no results.
For example, a malicious user may take a flashloan, swap a huge amount of token supply out of the system decreasing `tokenSupply`, call `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()` and then repay the flashloan, minting a much lower amount of $G.
Even without malicious intent, in times of higher volatility the amount minted may become very low.

In short, due to this issue, it is possible to decrease the reserve ratio significant without expanding the $G supply.

### Root Cause

In `GoodDollarExpansionController:175`, no minimium amounts are enforced. Or the function could be made permissioned by keepers.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The most obvious attack path is the one described in the summary.
1. Malicious user takes a flash loan of $G.
2. Then swaps in the `Broker` the $G for reserve, which decreases the token supply as it burns the $G.
3. Calls `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()`, which mints a very low amount of token supply.
4. Repays the flash loan.
Alternatively, this flow may happen without flashloans or malicious intent in times of higher volatility.

### Impact

The ability to expand $G is compromised and the reserve ratio will keep decreasing.

### PoC

`GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()` enforces no limits or permission on the caller.
```solidity
function mintUBIFromExpansion(bytes32 exchangeId) external returns (uint256 amountMinted) {
  IBancorExchangeProvider.PoolExchange memory exchange = IBancorExchangeProvider(address(goodDollarExchangeProvider))
    .getPoolExchange(exchangeId);
  ExchangeExpansionConfig memory config = getExpansionConfig(exchangeId);

  bool shouldExpand = block.timestamp > config.lastExpansion + config.expansionFrequency;
  if (shouldExpand || config.lastExpansion == 0) {
    uint256 reserveRatioScalar = _getReserveRatioScalar(config);

    exchangeExpansionConfigs[exchangeId].lastExpansion = uint32(block.timestamp);
    amountMinted = goodDollarExchangeProvider.mintFromExpansion(exchangeId, reserveRatioScalar);

    IGoodDollar(exchange.tokenAddress).mint(address(distributionHelper), amountMinted);
    distributionHelper.onDistribution(amountMinted);

    // Ignored, because contracts only interacts with trusted contracts and tokens
    // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
    emit ExpansionUBIMinted(exchangeId, amountMinted);
  }
}
```
`GoodDollarExchangeProvider::mintFromExpansion()` formula scales pro-rata to `tokenSupply`:
```solidity
   * @dev Calculates the amount of G$ tokens that need to be minted as a result of the expansion
   *      while keeping the current price the same.
   *      calculation: amountToMint = (tokenSupply * reserveRatio - tokenSupply * newRatio) / newRatio
   */
  function mintFromExpansion(
  ...
```

`BancorExchangeProvider::executeSwap()` decreases the total supply when `tokenIn != exchange.reserveAsset`. Or, in other words, by transferring in $G it decreases `exchange.tokenSupply`:
```solidity
function executeSwap(bytes32 exchangeId, address tokenIn, uint256 scaledAmountIn, uint256 scaledAmountOut) internal {
  PoolExchange memory exchange = getPoolExchange(exchangeId);
  if (tokenIn == exchange.reserveAsset) {
    exchange.reserveBalance += scaledAmountIn;
    exchange.tokenSupply += scaledAmountOut;
  } else {
    require(exchange.reserveBalance >= scaledAmountOut, "Insufficient reserve balance for swap");
    exchange.reserveBalance -= scaledAmountOut;
    exchange.tokenSupply -= scaledAmountIn;
  }
  exchanges[exchangeId].reserveBalance = exchange.reserveBalance;
  exchanges[exchangeId].tokenSupply = exchange.tokenSupply;
}
```

### Mitigation

Specify minimum amounts of $G to mint for every expansion or make the function permissioned.

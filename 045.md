# `TradingLimits::update()` incorrectly only rounds up when `deltaFlowUnits` becomes 0, which will silently increase trading limits

### Summary

[TradingLimits::update()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/libraries/TradingLimits.sol#L124) divides the traded funds by the decimals of the token, int256 _deltaFlowUnits = _deltaFlow / int256((10 ** uint256(decimals)));`. In a token with 18 decimals, for example, swapping 1.999...e18 tokens will lead to a `_deltaFlowUnits` of just `1`, taking a major error. This can be exploited to swap up to twice the trading limit, if tokens are swapped 2 by 2 and the state is updated only by 1 each time. Overall, even without malicious intent, the limits will always be bypassed due to the rounding.

### Root Cause

In `TradingLimits:135`, it only rounds up whenever `deltaFlowUnits` becomes 0, but the error is just as big if it becomes 1 from 2, effectively not providing enough protection.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `Broker::swapIn/Out()` with amounts in and out that produce rounding errors (almost always).

### Impact

The trading limits may be severely bypassed with malicious intent (by double the amount) or by a smaller but still significant amount organically.

### PoC

`TradingLimits::update()` only rounds up when `deltaFlowUnits` becomes 0.
```solidity
function update(
  ITradingLimits.State memory self,
  ITradingLimits.Config memory config,
  int256 _deltaFlow,
  uint8 decimals
) internal view returns (ITradingLimits.State memory) {
  int256 _deltaFlowUnits = _deltaFlow / int256((10 ** uint256(decimals)));
  require(_deltaFlowUnits <= MAX_INT48, "dFlow too large");
  
  int48 deltaFlowUnits = int48(_deltaFlowUnits);
  if (deltaFlowUnits == 0) {
    deltaFlowUnits = _deltaFlow > 0 ? int48(1) : int48(-1);
  }
  ...
```

### Mitigation

The correct fix is:
```solidity
int256 _deltaFlowUnits = (_deltaFlow - 1) / int256((10 ** uint256(decimals))) + 1;
```

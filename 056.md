# Insufficient input validation could lead to a DOS in swapOut

### Summary

Insufficient input validation in `BancorExchangeProvider::_setExitContribution` means that exitContribution can = MAX_WEIGHT, which can cause a denial of service in swapOut whenever the tokenIn isn't the reserve asset as there will be a divide by 0 error. 

### Root Cause

```solidity 
  function _setExitContribution(bytes32 exchangeId, uint32 exitContribution) internal {
    require(exchanges[exchangeId].reserveAsset != address(0), "Exchange does not exist");
    require(exitContribution <= MAX_WEIGHT, "Exit contribution is too high");

    PoolExchange storage exchange = exchanges[exchangeId];
    exchange.exitContribution = exitContribution;
    emit ExitContributionSet(exchangeId, exitContribution);
  }
```
This function is called by the owner through setExitContribution and in this function, it is required that exitContribution <= MAX_WEIGHT [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L265) therefore, exitContribution can equal MAX_WEIGHT. 

The MAX_WEIGHT variable is utilised in `BancorExchangeProvider::getScaledAmountIn` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L311) in the calculation:
`scaledAmountOut = (scaledAmountOut * MAX_WEIGHT) / (MAX_WEIGHT - exchange.exitContribution);` Therefore, when exitContribution = MAX_WEIGHT, MAX_WEIGHT - exchange.exitContribution = 0, so there will be a divide by 0 error and the swapOut function will be unable to be called for any asset that isn't the reserve asset. 

As a result the swapOut function, which calls _getScaledAmountOut will return a division by 0 error consistently, causing a denial of service when the tokenIn isn't the reserve asset. 

### Internal pre-conditions

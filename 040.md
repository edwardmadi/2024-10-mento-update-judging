# `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()` expansion rate will not match the expected due to delays when calling it

### Summary

[GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/GoodDollarExpansionController.sol#L170) expands the supply of the exchange every `config.expansionFrequency`. However, it only expands a number of times equal to `numberOfExpansions = (block.timestamp - config.lastExpansion) / config.expansionFrequency;`, which rounds down and will calculate much less expansion than it should. 

For example, if the time that passes is `1.99 * config.expansionFrequency`, it will round down to a number of expansions to 1, but if `2 * config.expansionFrequency` exactly passes the number of expansions is 2.

As a result of this rounding error, the expansion rate over a longer timeframe will be severely affected.

Additionally, it is impossible to guarantee that `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()` is called exactly after `config.expansionFrequency` passes due to natural blockchain delays, which means an error will always exist.

### Root Cause

In `GoodDollarExpansionController:233`, the number of expansions calculated rounds down, taking significant rounding errors.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. `GoodDollarExpansionController::mintUBIFromExpansion()` is called and the number of expansions rounds down.

### Impact

The protocol's expansion rate does not match the expected over a longer term.

### PoC

`GoodDollarExpansionController::_getReserveRatioScalar()`, which calculates the number of expansions, severely rounds down.
```solidity
function _getReserveRatioScalar(ExchangeExpansionConfig memory config) internal view returns (uint256) {
  uint256 numberOfExpansions;

  // If there was no previous expansion, we expand once.
  if (config.lastExpansion == 0) {
    numberOfExpansions = 1;
  } else {
    numberOfExpansions = (block.timestamp - config.lastExpansion) / config.expansionFrequency;
  }

  uint256 stepReserveRatioScalar = MAX_WEIGHT - config.expansionRate;
  return unwrap(powu(wrap(stepReserveRatioScalar), numberOfExpansions));
}
```

### Mitigation

Add precision to the number of expansions.

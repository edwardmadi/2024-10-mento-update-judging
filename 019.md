# `BancorExchangeProvider::swapOut()` pulls too little reserve token due to rounding down , which will leave funds stuck

### Summary

[BancorExchangeProvider::swapOut()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/goodDollar/BancorExchangeProvider.sol#L208) converts the `scaledAmountIn` to `amountIn` by dividing by `tokenPrecisionMultipliers[tokenIn]`, but does not round up. This means that users will send less reserve/supply tokens to the exchange than the reserve/supply amount added. As such, the exchange will have less reserve than the tracked one and revert whenever users attempt to withdraw these non existant funds. The amounts will add up overtime and will be come significant.

### Root Cause

In `BancorExchangeProvider:219`, the amout in calculated is not rounded up when dividing by the token decimals factor, `amountIn = scaledAmountIn / tokenPrecisionMultipliers[tokenIn];`. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Token does has less than 18 decimals, which is supported as per the multipliers.

### Attack Path

1. Users call `Broker::swapOut()`, which calls `GoodDollarExchange::swapOut()`, which calls `BancorExchangeProvider::swapOut()` and the reserve storage varaible is increased more than the amount of reserve assets transferred in.

### Impact

The protocol will have increasing stuck funds and user swapping will fail due to not having enough funds.

### PoC

Add the following `POC` to `BancorExchangeProvider.t.sol`, showing that the reserve increases more than the amount of tokens transferred in.
```solidity
function test_POC_swapOut_whenTokenInIsReserveAsset_shouldSwapOut() public {
  BancorExchangeProvider bancorExchangeProvider = initializeBancorExchangeProvider();
  uint256 amountOut = 1e18;

  vm.mockCall(
    poolExchange1.reserveAsset,
    abi.encodeWithSignature("decimals()"),
    abi.encode(8)
  );

  bytes32 exchangeId = bancorExchangeProvider.createExchange(poolExchange1);

  (, , , uint256 reserveBalanceBefore, , ) = bancorExchangeProvider.exchanges(exchangeId);

  vm.prank(brokerAddress);
  uint256 amountIn = bancorExchangeProvider.swapOut(exchangeId, address(reserveToken), address(token), amountOut);
  (, , , uint256 reserveBalanceAfter, , ) = bancorExchangeProvider.exchanges(exchangeId);

  assertEq(reserveBalanceAfter - reserveBalanceBefore, 1.000006666688888926e18);
  assertEq(amountIn, 1.00000666e8);
}
```

### Mitigation

Round up when calculating `amountIn = (scaledAmountIn - 1) / tokenPrecisionMultipliers[tokenIn]; + 1`.

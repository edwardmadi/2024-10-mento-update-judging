# Users will be DoSed from swapping if they specify the real maximum amount to swap

### Summary

[TradingLimits::update()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/libraries/TradingLimits.sol#L124) calculates the new netflow of the asset by using [TradingLimits::safeINT48Add()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-mento-update/blob/main/mento-core/contracts/libraries/TradingLimits.sol#L169). In the latter, it ensures that the result would not overflow an `int48` number, but the lower limit is incorrectly defined as `-1 * MAX_INT48`, as in reality `int48` numbers can be as small as `-1 * MAX_INT48 - 1`.

The swap reverts because the user may infer that there is `type(int48).min - self.netflow` left and swap this amount, but in reality there is only `type(int48).min - 1 - self.netflow` left, which reverts.

### Root Cause

In `TradingLimits:169`, the lower limit is incorrectly defined as `-1 * MAX_INT48`, which is 1 unit bigger than the real limit, `type(int48).min`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User swaps via `Broker::swapIn/Out()` with the real maximum amount possible but it reverts because the lower limit is bigger than it should.

### Impact

Swap is DoSed due to the lower limit bug which is time sensitive as the user may get a worse price when it tries again.

### PoC

function test_POC_tradingLimitsMin() public pure {
  console.log(type(int48).min));
  console.log(-1 * type(int48).max));
}

### Mitigation

```solidity
MIN_INT48 = type(int48).min;
...
function safeINT48Add(int48 a, int48 b) internal pure returns (int48) {
  int256 c = int256(a) + int256(b);
  require(c >= MIN_INT48 && c <= MAX_INT48, "int48 addition overflow");
  return int48(c);
}
```
